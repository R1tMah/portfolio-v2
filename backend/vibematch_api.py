    1) On a 0â€“100 scale, how compatible is their taste with mine? Make sure you look at the penalty artists too. Bonus Points if they're on the list, but take into account the type/genre of artists too, and make sure you look at the tiers, with 1 the best. Be as objective as possible and don't be afraid to give a lower score, but don't be too harsh.
    2) Give a oneâ€‘sentence funny caption about our shared tastes, but don't reference tiers in any way and don't mention any artists that they didn't list.
    Reply in JSON like:
